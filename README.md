# Android_Studio_projects

This is the final project project created for the course of "Android for Java" of the Vanderbilt University.

This small application replicates a simple calculator that is capable of additions, substractions, division and multiplication.
The course provided the structure of the application, and after that the logic behind each of the mathematical functions were created using OBP.
