# Android_Studio_projects

This is the final project project created for the course of "Android for Java" of the Vanderbilt University.

This small application replicates a simple calculator that is capable of additions, substractions, division and multiplication.
The course provided the structure of the application, and after that the logic behind each of the mathematical functions were created using OBP.

All of the logic was created according to a rubric presented by the same course. The structure and design of the application was provided by the course, and the logic was created by me. The copy and plagiarism of these may cause a temporal or permanent ban of the same course. I am posting this project as an addition to my portfolio and for future reference; if you would like to use it for inspiration or debugging issues, feel free to do so.
